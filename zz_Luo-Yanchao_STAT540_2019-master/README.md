## Goals for this course
This repository will contain my work in STAT540. I want to learn some skills to handle the high dimentional data such as Pricipal components analysis and Clustering analysis. I hope this will provide me a new way of thinking about my research problems.

I am also looking forward to participating in group projects with my classmates. :blush:

 His words inspired me when I was in trouble.
