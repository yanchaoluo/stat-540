Introduction
------------

In this Seminar we go over packages and codes for performing supervised learning and evaluation in R. In supervised learning, one is given a training data set with a known response, or such as a class, and a set of covariates or variables. The goal is to use this set to generate a model that predicts values for a response given covariates in a new dataset. A supervised learning process can be decomposed into the following steps:

Step 1: Data preprocessing. Before getting started with feature selection and training our model, we must make sure we have adjusted the data to account for any batch effects (technical sources of variation like measuring samples in groups) or biases from outliers (individuals that look distinctly "different" from the rest of our sample).

Step 2: Select Features. Before training a model, in many applications, it is usually important to perform a pre-filtering step in which one retains only the most informative features (e.g. genes) as candidate "biomarkers". The amount of features retained to select and train a model is up to the analyst and the methods used in the next steps. For example,running some methods may be unfeasible or have an outrageously slow runtime with a large number of features.

Step 3: Select and train a classifier. Once the set of candidate markers have been selected, the next step is to select and train a model to predict the labels of a test data. We will also tune parameters for each classifier using cross-validation.

Step 4: Test. Finally, a model is chosen and used to predict labels of a test data. From there we evaluate the model's performance.

R packages
----------

There are many packages for performing supervised learning in R, each of which may implement one or more algorithms. There have also been at least two major efforts to unify these libraries under a common framework to make them easier to use: MLInterfaces and CMA. Although these may be useful and save you a lot of time in your analysis, it is important that you understand what these packages are doing and what they are not doing. Thus, I will not use these packages in this Seminar but I encourage you to reproduce the analysis using at least one of them! (I recommend CMA).

Install the following packages from Bioconductor: CMA and GEOquery, and from CRAN: ROCR, car, e1071 (for SVM), and glmnet along with ther dependencies.

Data Set
--------

This seminar is based on a dataset that comes from a paper by Smeets et al. 2010, who studied Affymetrix expression profiles from primary breast tumors. Smeets group was interested in whether tumors which had spread to lymph nodes (LN positive, generally a bad sign) have different gene expression profiles than LN negative tumors. If so, a gene expression signature can be use to predict tumor class.

Their data set contains 24236 genes on 116 samples. The status of the lymph node is known for each sample, with 59 LN positive and 57 LN negative. Samples were divided into two parts: 96 samples (48 LN positive and 48 LN negative) were used as a "training" set and 20 samples (11 LN positive and 9 LN negative) were used as a "test" set. There is also a quantitative measure, "LnRatio", the fraction of affected lymph nodes, presumably reflecting "how bad" the LnStatus is. Thus, we can use this dataset to illustrate classification and regularization methods! This seminar will focus on the first task, i.e., classification. In the past, Paul selected this dataset to illustrate the challenges of supervised learning tasks!

In the paper, the authors trained a support vector machine classifier to distinguish between LN positive and LN negative tumors (i.e., classification), and evaluated the results using ROC curves. After some optimization, they got an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.66 on the training set and 0.65 on the test data. This is better than chance, but still not very convincing results about the relevance of the derived molecular signature (random chance would give an AUC of 0.5; perfect classification would give an AUC of 1.0).

Data Preparation
----------------

First, let's retrieve our datasets from GEO with getGEO from GEOquery package. Warning: this may take several minutes! So to avoid re-downloading in the future, save the data once you get it into a good shape.

``` r
if(file.exists("class_LNstatus.Rdata")) { # if previously downloaded
  load("class_LNstatus.Rdata")
} else { # if downloading for the first time
  # takes a several mins!; returns a list
  datgeo <- getGEO('GSE23177', GSEMatrix = TRUE) 
  dat <- datgeo[[1]]   #Note that dat is an ExpressionSets
  
  str(pData(dat), max.level = 0)
  
  # extract only those variables of interest 
  pData(dat) <-
    subset(pData(dat),
           select = c("characteristics_ch1.2",
                      "characteristics_ch1.3","characteristics_ch1"))
  names(pData(dat))<-c("LnStatus", "LnRatio", "Set")

  #Note: LNRatio will not be used in this Seminar. However, you can use it to try some of the regularization techniques learned in class
  
  # split the ExpressionSet into training and test sets. 
  train.es <- dat[, dat$Set == "patient type: training set"]
  test.es <- dat[ , dat$Set != "patient type: training set"]

  #Re-label factor
  pData(train.es)$LnStatus <-
      recode(pData(train.es)$LnStatus, "levels(pData(train.es)$LnStatus)[1]='neg'; else='pos'", levels = c('neg', 'pos'))

  pData(test.es)$LnStatus <-
      recode(pData(test.es)$LnStatus, "levels(pData(test.es)$LnStatus)[1]='neg'; else='pos'",
             levels = c('neg', 'pos'))

  # create data matrices with expression values (probesets in rows). Some of the functions we will use do not take ExpressionSets as objects
  trainDat <- exprs(train.es)
  testDat <- exprs(test.es)

  # Redefine the quantitative variable LnRatio to make it a numeric variable.
  ntrain <- dim(pData(train.es))[1]
  ntest <- dim(pData(test.es))[1]
  
  pData(train.es)$LnRatio <- as.numeric(unlist(strsplit(as.vector(unlist(pData(train.es)$LnRatio)), ":", fixed = TRUE))[(1:ntrain)*2])
  pData(test.es)$LnRatio <- as.numeric(unlist(strsplit(as.vector(unlist(pData(test.es)$LnRatio)), ":", fixed = TRUE))[(1:ntest)*2])

  # save the data to avoid future re-downloading
  save(dat,trainDat,testDat,train.es,test.es, file = "class_LNstatus.Rdata")
}
```

Now, we can do some exploratory analysis of the data before trying some classification methods.

``` r
# understand your data for classification
table(pData(train.es)$LnStatus)
```

    ## 
    ## neg pos 
    ##  48  48

``` r
table(pData(test.es)$LnStatus)
```

    ## 
    ## neg pos 
    ##   9  11

``` r
# understand the continuous response
tapply(pData(train.es)$LnRatio,pData(train.es)$LnStatus,summary)
```

    ## $neg

```

    ## $neg

Classification
--------------

The prediction of a discrete response is usually refer to as *classification*. A response taking values over a finite set of labels is essentially the same thing as a factor. We will use the dataset from Smeets et al. to find the *best-trained* classifier and use it to predict the `LnStatus` of the 20 samples in the test set, i.e., classify those as "lymph node positive" or "negative".

### Data preprocessing

We should check to ensure there are no missing values in our data.

``` r
sum(is.na(trainDat))
```

    ## [1] 0

``` r
sum(is.na(testDat))
```

    ## [1] 0

Here we see there are no missing values in our dataset, so we don't have to worry about that.

Other pre-processing operations that can be done are: - centering, scaling, normalizing - imputing missing data - transforming individual features (like boolean measurements)

When you are working with expression data, you may also need to use some normalization methods to ensure your variables are comparable across all your samples. For example, when working with count data, it is advised to log transformed and quantile-normalize your data, so that your samples have similar distributions.

### Feature and Model Selection

We will now use cross-validation to find the best set of features to predict our response. Thus, I will divide the training set into 6 folds (the authors used 10 folds). We also want the proportion of positive and negative examples in each split to be approximately the same as for the full data set (i.e., stratified 6-fold CV with 8 positive and 8 negative samples within each fold). For each round of cross-validation, we use one fold as the test data and the rest of the data as training to select features and train different classifier.

### Cross-validation

Although it makes sense to proceed as described above, many methods are available and many constants within methods need to be selected in these steps. Thus, *cross-validation* is usually required to *evaluate* how well different trained models work and select the *best* model to proceed. Note that although you may only want to select among different choices available in Step 2, the cross-validation needs to start in Step 1. Why? The results of the cross-validation will be over-optimistic and biased if the samples in the test sets of the cross-validation (i.e., left-out folds) were used to *select* the most promising features in Step 1!! For example, if the performance of a complex model is (artificially) good, you may not penalize regression coefficients enough in Step 2, and may yield to a poor performance in Step 3.

This is why, as a general rule, we never evaluate a model on the same data we used to train that model.

In many studies, in the absence of a test set, cross-validation is used to estimate performance. In those cases, *nested cross-validation* is required! The inner cross-validation will be used to select features and tune parameters, the outer cross-validation will be used to test each selected model.

In this seminar, we will work with a dataset that has both a training and a test set. Thus, we will not do a nested cross-validation. However, keep it in mind for your project or future work, especially if you have a small number of samples/subjects!

#### Making cross validation splits

This is not the only way to create splits of the training data to run a cross-validation. Note that if the samples can not be evenly divided into the nfolds you specified, then you need to complete the matrices below with NAs and call for entries different from NA at those folds.

``` r
nfold <- 6
splitData <- function(train.es, nfold, seed = NA){
tabTrain <- table(train.es$LnStatus)

  indlist <- sapply(names(tabTrain), function(z) which(train.es$LnStatus == z), simplify = FALSE)
  if(!is.na(seed)){
    set.seed(seed)
  }
  #Each row contains 8 pos and 8 negative samples for 6 folds
  res <- list()
  res$fold.pos <- matrix(sample(indlist[["pos"]]),nrow=nfold)
  res$fold.neg <- matrix(sample(indlist[["neg"]]),nrow=nfold)
  return(res)
}
result <- splitData(train.es, nfold, seed = 1234)
fold.pos <- result$fold.pos
fold.neg <- result$fold.neg
```

*Note*: with `CMA` you can use the command `GenerateLearningsets` to split the training data into folds. However, it does not show you how the data was split. Thus, you either use CMA for all or you write your own script. Below is how we would generate the splits above using CMA:

``` r
splits <- GenerateLearningsets(y = train.es$LnStatus, method="CV", fold=6, strat= TRUE)
```

### Loop for feature selection and modeling

To illustrate how to select a model, I will use the top-50 genes selected by `limma` (within each fold). Note that this number is very arbitrary and other options may make more sense like using a p-value threshold or testing different options with this CV. For this example, I'm using only the top-50 genes as methods like LDA and Logit can not be run on more features than samples. However, other methods like kNN or SVM will do well with more features.

In this example, I will compare 7 different models: kNN for k={1,5,10,15}, LDA, Logit, SVM. Feel free to add other methods to the list!

``` r
#Define here the constants that you will not evaluate. For example, I will use the top-50 limma genes

ngenes <- 50
nmethod <- 7 #number of methods you plan to compare. 

#Define an output object here to store results
pr.err <- matrix(-1, nfold,nmethod, dimnames=list(paste0("Fold",1:nfold),c("1NN","5NN","10NN", "15NN","LDA","Logit","SVM")))

 for(i in 1:nfold){

  #Test Fold for the i-th step
  testdat.fold<-trainDat[,c(fold.pos[i,],fold.neg[i,])]
  #I will create a factor of classes for the test set of the i_th fold
  testclass.fold<-train.es$LnStatus[c(fold.pos[i,],fold.neg[i,])]
  
    
  #The rest of the samples are the training set for the i-th step
  traindat.fold<-trainDat[,-c(fold.pos[i,],fold.neg[i,])]
  trainclass.fold<-train.es$LnStatus[-c(fold.pos[i,],fold.neg[i,])]

  #Step 1: feature selection (do you remember limma?). 

  # Note that a different set of genes will be selected for each fold! you can then compare how consistent these sets were.

  limma.dat<-as.data.frame(traindat.fold)
  desMat <- model.matrix(~ trainclass.fold, limma.dat) #design matrix
  trainFit <- lmFit(limma.dat, desMat)
  eBtrainFit <- eBayes(trainFit)
  
  # top-50 limma genes
  top.fold <- topTable(eBtrainFit, coef = which(colnames(coef(trainFit)) != "(Intercept)"),
                       n = ngenes,sort.by="P")
  
  #Retain the top-50 limma genes from the train and test sets
  traindat.fold <- traindat.fold[rownames(top.fold),]
  testdat.fold <-  testdat.fold[rownames(top.fold),]

  
  #STEP 2: select a classifier
  #Set a counter for the method tested
  l <- 0

  #kNN classifiers
  for(kk in c(1,5,10,15)) {
    #every time you get inside this loop, the l counter gets redefined (i.e., 1, 2, etc for         method 1, method 2, etc)
    l <- l+1

    #knn needs samples in rows
    yhat.knn <- knn(train=t(traindat.fold), test=t(testdat.fold), cl=trainclass.fold,
                    k = kk)
    #Store the prediction error for each kk within this fold
    pr.err[i,l]<- mean(testclass.fold != yhat.knn)
                          } #end of kNN loop

  #LDA method. Note that you can change the prior parameter to reflect a different proportion of case and control samples. The default is to use the class proportions from the training set.
  
  m.lda <- lda(x=t(traindat.fold), group=trainclass.fold, prior=c(.5, .5))
  yhat.lda <- predict(m.lda, newdata=t(testdat.fold))$class
  pr.err[i,"LDA"] <-mean(testclass.fold != yhat.lda)
   
  #Logit
  glm.dat <- data.frame(t(traindat.fold), group=trainclass.fold)
  
  # 50 factors still will cause optimization warnings  
  # Try without warning suppression to see 
  # To further reduce parameters, regularized regression can be used 
  # To use regularized regression uncomment lines followed by "uncomment for regularized regression" 
  suppressWarnings( m.log <- glm(group ~ ., data=glm.dat,family=binomial) ) 
  
  # uncomment for regularized regression 
  # m.log <- glmnet( t(traindat.fold) , trainclass.fold ,family="binomial") 

  pr.log <- predict(m.log,newdata=data.frame(t(testdat.fold)),type="response")
  
  # uncomment for regularized regression 
  # pr.log <- predict(m.log,newdata=data.frame(t(testdat.fold)),type="response",newx=t(testdat.fold)) 
  
  pr.cl <- rep(0,length(testclass.fold))
  pr.cl[pr.log > 1/2] <- "pos"
  pr.cl[pr.log <= 1/2] <- "neg"

  pr.cl <- factor(pr.cl)
  pr.err[i,"Logit"] <- mean( pr.cl != testclass.fold )

  #SVM
  m.svm <- svm(x=t(traindat.fold), y=trainclass.fold, cost=1, type="C-classification", 
               kernel="linear")
  pr.svm <- predict(m.svm,newdata=t(testdat.fold)) 
   
  pr.err[i,"SVM"] <- mean( pr.svm != testclass.fold )
  } #end of CV loop
```

### Error Rates

Now you can get the average prediction error for all methods. Note that the prediction errors are high! not too much hope for the real test run!

``` r
cv.err <- colMeans(pr.err)

# mean - 1 sd (sd of the 6 error rates)
ls <- cv.err - apply(pr.err, 2, sd)

# mean + 1 sd (sd of the 6 error rates)
us <- cv.err + apply(pr.err, 2, sd)

# plot the results
plot(1:nmethod, cv.err, ylim=c(0, 1), xlim=c(1, (nmethod+.5)),type='n', 
axes=FALSE, xlab='Classifier', ylab='Error rate',main="6-fold CV Error")

for(j in 1:ncol(pr.err)) 
   points(jitter(rep(j, 6), factor=2), jitter(pr.err[,j]), cex=0.8, pch='X', col='gray')

for(i in 1:nmethod)
   lines(c(i, i), c(ls[i], us[i]), lwd=2, col='gray')
points(1:nmethod, ls, pch=19, col='red')
points(1:nmethod, us, pch=19, col='green')
points(1:nmethod, cv.err, pch=19, cex=1.5, col='black')
axis(2, ylab='Error rate')
axis(1, 1:nmethod, colnames(pr.err))

box()
```

### Results of the CV

According to these results, LDA and 10NN may be the better classifier to try in the test data. However, remember that this CV results depend on the first split of the data we did. Thus, we need to repeat this CV

**Exercise 1**: perform 100 runs of this CV before selecting a model to test! We can do this by running different random splits using the `splitData` function we created without a seed, and selecting the best average error across each run of CV. Add at least one rule to select data for use in the underlying models, such as a P value threshold for genes selected in limma rather than just the top 50 genes by P value, or a different cost for the SVM model.

**Exercise 2**: Use AUC as a criteria to select a model based on the training data! Tip: extract the predicted probabilities from each method and use the calculateAUC function defined below:

``` r
require(ROCR)
calculateAUC <- function(predictions,labels){
  tmp_predictions <- ROCR::prediction(
    as.numeric(predictions),
    as.numeric(labels)
  )
  perf <- performance(tmp_predictions, measure = "auc")
  return(unlist(slot(perf,"y.values")))
}

# Example: Calculate the AUC for our SVM predictions
calculateAUC(pr.svm,testclass.fold)
```

Testing the selected model
--------------------------

Now that we decided on which method we are going to use to classify samples in the test set, we need to train the model using the *FULL* training set and then classify samples of the test set. I will use the 10NN model.

``` r
yhat.knn <- knn(train=t(trainDat), test=t(testDat), cl=train.es$LnStatus,
                     k = 10)
#Store the prediction error for each kk within this fold
pr.errTest<- mean(test.es$LnStatus != yhat.knn)
pr.errTest
```

    ## [1] 0.45

What does the prediction error mean? In this instance, we have evaluated how often the prediction matched the actual lymph node status, against the total number of cases. This is the **accuracy** metric.

Not good! In real practice, you should not keep trying until we get a good result! In fact, you must use cross-validation on the training dataset to evaluate different parameters and classifiers, and only evaluate the generalizability of the *best* model on the test set. However, in this seminar, I encourage you to try different options **as an exercise** and to see how much the results can change.

CMA

Many steps of the CV defined above can be easily done with CMA. For example, Step 1 in the loop above can also be done using 'CMA' with the function 'GeneSelection', which selects the most informative features (e.g., gene) to build a classifier within each of the splits generated by 'GenerateLearningsets'. Some learning algorithms do better if you only give them "useful" features.

``` r
featureScores<-GeneSelection(X=t(trainDat), y=train.es$LnStatus, learningsets=splits, method="limma")
```

    ## GeneSelection: iteration 1 
    ## GeneSelection: iteration 2 
    ## GeneSelection: iteration 3 
    ## GeneSelection: iteration 4 
    ## GeneSelection: iteration 5 
    ## GeneSelection: iteration 6

``` r
#Compare list of selected genes using:
toplist(featureScores)
```

This looks promising since I get TTC3 and at least a couple of other genes that show up on Table 3 of the paper.

Similarly, you can use CMA to train and test a classifier within each CV fold (learningsets). However, there are things you can not do within CMA or that CMA is not doing right. For example, CMA can not do a full nested cross-validation. Additionally, it is not trivial to train the selected in the full dataset and then test it in the test set. CMA is more designed for CV. Thus, it is good to know how to do this things by hand as well.

Paul solved this problem in the following way: he made a `learningsets` object that has just one "split" defined by the samples in the training set.

``` r
m<-matrix(which(dat$Set=="patient type: training set"), 1)

full.learningset<-new("learningsets", learnmatrix=m, method="my own", ntrain=96, iter=1)

fullFeatureScores<-GeneSelection(X=t(exprs(dat)), learningsets= full.learningset, y=dat$LnStatus, method="t.test")
```

    ## GeneSelection: iteration 1

``` r
testclassif<-classification(X=t(exprs(dat)), y=dat$LnStatus, learningsets= full.learningset, genesel=fullFeatureScores, nbgene = 100, classifier =pknnCMA, k=5)
```

    ## iteration 1

``` r
#Evaluation:
tres<-testclassif[[1]]
ftable(tres)
```

    ## number of missclassifications:  11 
    ## missclassification rate:  0.55 
    ## sensitivity: 0.545 
    ## specificity: 0.333 
    ##     predicted
    ## true 0 1
    ##    0 3 6

Note: his optimized classifier did terribly as well.

Multiclass learning

You won't always have a binary learning problem, where you are classifying a sample into 1 of 2 classes. Sometimes we might want to train a classifier a classifier with more than two classes. Here we will use the *caret* and *mlbench* packages for classification on a multi-class problem.

``` r
library(caret)
```

    ## Loading required package: ggplot2

    ## 
    ## Attaching package: 'caret'

    ## The following objects are masked from 'package:CMA':
    ## 
    ##     best, rfe

``` r
library(mlbench)
```

We will be using the Soybean dataset, where our prediction is for the different problems associated with soybean crops. Our dataset has 683 samples, and 35 features being measured for each sample. Our categories are 19.

``` r
cv_folds <- trainControl(method="cv", number=5)
data(Soybean)
unique(Soybean$Class)
```

Let us pre-process our data.

``` r
#Remove rows (samples) with missing values  
soybean_x = Soybean[rowSums(is.na(Soybean)) == 0,]
#Then remove columns (features) with missing values  
soybean_x = soybean_x[,colSums(is.na(soybean_x)) == 0]
dim(soybean_x)
```

    ## [1] 562  36

We are left with 562 samples and 35 attributes. The first column, `Class`, describes the categories. We will refactor this column since we have removed certain columns (and possibly some of the 19 classes)

``` r
soybean_x$Class = (as.factor(as.character(soybean_x$Class)))
unique(soybean_x$Class)
```

    ##  [1] diaporthe-stem-canker  charcoal-rot           rhizoctonia-root-rot  
    ##  [4] phytophthora-rot       brown-stem-rot         powdery-mildew        
    ##  [7] downy-mildew           brown-spot             bacterial-blight      
    ## [10] bacterial-pustule      purple-seed-stain      anthracnose           
    ## [13] phyllosticta-leaf-spot alternarialeaf-spot    frog-eye-leaf-spot    
    ## 15 Levels: alternarialeaf-spot anthracnose ... rhizoctonia-root-rot

Now we have 15 classes!

In this instance, we don't have an external test set for evaluation, so we will be assessing the performance on a held-out test set. First, we create the held-out test set. *Note* that we are holding out this test set from our training data, and then performing data-splitting for validation within our training subset. In practise, like we did earlier, you would want to loop this multiple times with holding out a test set and training on the remainder dataset (using cross validation or bootstrapping to estimate your model accuracy on the test set).

``` r
trainIndex <- createDataPartition(soybean_x$Class, p = .8,  list = FALSE,  times = 1)
soyTrain <- soybean_x[ trainIndex,]
soyTest  <- soybean_x[-trainIndex,]
```

**Cross validation results** We set up our cross-validation folds. Note we can also choose the option 'cv' or 'LOOCV' instead of 'repeatedcv'. With 'repeatedcv', we don't have to manually set up the multiple loops we did when we were using CMA.

``` r
#Prepare resampling method for Cross-Validation folds  
set.seed(7)
cv_control = trainControl(method="repeatedcv", number=5, repeats=10, classProbs=FALSE) #summaryFunction=mnLogLoss)
modelSvm_cv <- train(Class~., data=soyTrain, method="svmRadial", metric="Accuracy", trControl=cv_control, trace=FALSE)
```

When fitting this model with SVM, you might get the following request: '1 package is needed for this model and is not installed. (kernlab). Would you like to try to install it now?'. Enter *yes*.

We can also use bootstrap re-sampling instead of cross-validation folds. This means we take random samples from the dataset (with re-selection), against which to evaluate our model. This gives us an idea about hte variance of the model itself.

Bootstrapping is different from cross validation in that the latter splits the entire dataset into folds *without re-selection*.It is a robust method to estimate the accuracy of our model.

**Bootstrapped results**

``` r
#Prepare resamling method for Bootstrapping

set.seed(7)
cv_control = trainControl(method="boot", number=100, classProbs=FALSE) 
modelSvm_boot <- train(Class~., data=soyTrain, method="svmRadial", metric="Accuracy", trControl=cv_control, trace=FALSE)
